The **Sample_Data**  directory in the project git repository is the place to store **SAMPLE** datasets which should be of small size, **NOT** the entire datasets. 

The small sample datasets can be used to make your data preprocessing, feature engineering, or modeling scripts runnable. It can be helpful to quickly run the scripts that process or model the data, and understand what the scripts are doing.  

In each directory, there is a markdown file, which lists all datasets in each directory. Please provide the link to the full dataset in case one wants to access the full dataset.
